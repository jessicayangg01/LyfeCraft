## To do list (for myself):
- create an additional page for users to input their name and gender and character preference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46390231/how-can-i-create-a-text-input-box-with-pygame
- add a end screen for what happens after the character is too old 
- fix up UI to make it look less blocky
